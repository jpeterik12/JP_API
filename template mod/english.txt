-- INTRO
vig_1::The Black King had been an extravagant and unpleasant ruler. As the years went by, more and more of his subjects were won over by the White King who offered higher wages and genuinely decent work. And then they took his castle. His knights resigned from his service. Even his wife the Queen abandoned him.
vig_2::Before leaving, the last black bishop came to the Black King and told him "Thou hast been a bad king, yet thyne reign is still holy. Thou shalt retain a claim over thyne former subjects' souls, and we may yet have cause to fear thyne wrath. Thus heed my warning. The wrath of a man, as godly as might Thee be, is ever his undoing."
vig_3::But the Black King was abandoned by all, with not a rook left to his name. All he had left was his prized royal shotgun, the shreds of his dignity, and the growing fires of the prophesized wrath. Ever my undoing was it? Undone!! Just what more exactly could I lose?!? In his dark folly, the king loaded the shotgun and went to meet his final checkmate.

-- TRANSITION 4 or 5
vig_4::So many years' worth of new subjects... So much work to make them feel welcome and safe... All reduced to glass shards by one royal fucker with a shotgun. The White King would not indulge this, not one more floor. Quite literally bursting with rage, he loomed out to crush this egotistical maniac.
vig_5::So many years' worth of new subjects... So much work to make them feel welcome and safe... All reduced to glass shards by one royal fucker with a shotgun. The White King would not, could not stay aside and let the Conclave lead his kingdom to sheer ruin. Quite literally bursting with rage, the White King loomed out to crush this egotistical maniac.

-- ENDING 6-7
vig_6::And so it was that the wrath of the Black King finally carried him to victory. His turn to steal the White King's castles and subjects! They would have to endure his terrible rule once again...
vig_7::"Cheer up!" he would tell them, "at least thou didn't get blown to pieces!" as he upheld his shotgun and laughed. Undefeated, he had learned nothing. It wouldn't be too long before a new White King rises up and the whole story starts anew.

-- SECRET ENDING 8,9,10,11,12
vig_8::"Hah! Who's undone now!!" the Shotgun King yelled. But just as the Bishop died, the book left his hands and lifted off the board and into the sky's safe haven...
vig_9::"Not so fast." With his shotgun already loaded, the King took aim...
vig_10::... and blasted the book, turning it into a mass of fluttering, torn pages. "Holy words my ass!" he said, "None is holier than myself and this here shotgun!!"
vig_11::"Cheer up!" he would tell them, "at least thou didn't get blown to pieces!" as he upheld his shotgun and laughed. Undefeated, he had learned nothing. It wouldn't be too long before a new White King rises up and the whole story starts anew.
vig_12::"Cheer up! At least thou didn't get blown to pieces!" he said upholding the shotgun and laughed his most evil laugh. "And now, a new edict! No more books for you all!! Forbidden! Out with the holy books! From now on, I'm your God. The Shotgun God!!" His rule would be pitiless and feared by all forevermore.
